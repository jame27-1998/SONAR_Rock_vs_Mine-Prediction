# SONAR_Rock_vs_Mine-Prediction

Here we are building a system in Python that can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. For this use case, we are using the Logistic Regression Model for our prediction.

Logistic Regression: The linear regression fits a line and is used to predict a continuous value. For example, we estimate the price of a house using linear regression. However, the logistic regression fits an s-shaped function and predicts whether something is true or false. It is mainly used in binary classification problems.
